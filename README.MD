## What it does

SpellAlerter is a basic spell alert mod based off the original SpellAlert mod. See the images for the different alert types you can setup.
Features

* Add any spell and ability you want to be alerted to
* Three filters: Enemy Spellcasts, Enemy Buffs, and Friendly Debuffs
* Additional filtering for players only (reduces spam from things such as Mirror Image)
* Each alert can have its own sound play. It's similar to making triggers in MSBT but a lot more simplified.
* Optional minimap icon
* Data broker plugin
* All options are inside the GUI. Type /sa or /spellalerter to access them. 

## Localization

It should work with all language clients. It is currently only localized in English and Simplified Chinese. If you'd like to help translate see the Locales.lua file.

**r2:**

> Added debug mode toggle to the configuration GUI

> Fixed combat log scanning not working properly due to certain API changes made in BFA
<br>Fixed an error that would break the autocomplete feature when entering new spells in the configuration GUI

Known Issues:
> The predefined spell lists still need to be updated to account for BFA talent changes as well as new PVP talents. This only affects the autocomplete feature - spells can be entered normally and will be detected regardless

-----

**r1:**

> Renamed addon to CastAnnouncer to avoid conflicts and satisfy CF policy
<br>Packaging is now managed by CurseForge

Developer Notes:
> This is the initial release of the old SpellAlerter addon as a separate project (fork). It should function in Battle for Azeroth, though some things might still need updating.
<br>The old localization phrases will be added after it was revised and the localization system updated to be more future-proof.

**r1:**

> Renamed addon to CastAnnouncer to avoid conflicts and satisfy CF policy
<br>Packaging is now managed by CurseForge

Developer Notes:
> This is the initial release of the old SpellAlerter addon as a separate project (fork). It should function in Battle for Azeroth, though some things might still need updating.
<br>The old localization phrases will be added after it was revised and the localization system updated to be more future-proof.
